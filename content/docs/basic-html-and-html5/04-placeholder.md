Web developers traditionally use lorem ipsum text as placeholder text. The lorem ipsum text is randomly scraped from a famous passage by Cicero of Ancient Rome.

Lorem ipsum text has been used as placeholder text by typesetters since the 16th century, and this tradition continues on the web.

Well, 5 centuries is long enough. Since we're building a CatPhotoApp, let's use something called "kitty ipsum text".

### Challenge
Replace the text inside your `p` element with the first few words of this kitty ipsum text: `Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.`

- [ ] Your `p` element should contain the first few words of the provided `kitty ipsum` text <!--innerTextContains('p', 'kitty ipsum')-->
