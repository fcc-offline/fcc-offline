`p` elements are the preferred element for paragraph text on websites. `p` is short for "paragraph".
You can create a paragraph element like this:

`<p>I'm a p tag!</p>`

### Challenge

Create a p element below your h2 element, and give it the text `Hello Paragraph`.

Note: As a convention, all HTML tags are written in lowercase, for example `<p></p>` and not `<P></P>`.

- [ ] Your code should have a valid `p` element <!--has("p")-->
- [ ] Your `p` element should have the text "Hello Paragraph" <!--innerText("p") === "Hello Paragraph"-->
- [ ] Your `p` element should have a closing tag <!--hasHTML("</p")-->
