<!--
title=Say Hello to HTML Elements
code=<h1>Hello</h1>
-->


Welcome to freeCodeCamp's HTML coding challenges. These will walk you through web development step-by-step.
First, you'll start by building a simple web page using HTML.

Do you see the code in your code editor that says `<h1>Hello</h1>`? That's an HTML element.

Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag.

Opening tags look like this `<h1>`. Closing tags look like this `</h1>`.

The only difference between opening and closing tags is the forward slash after the opening bracket of a closing tag.
