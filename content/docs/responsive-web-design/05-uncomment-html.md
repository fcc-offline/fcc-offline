Commenting is a way that you can leave comments for other developers within your code without affecting the resulting output that is displayed to the end user.

Commenting is also a convenient way to make code inactive without having to delete it entirely.

Comments in HTML start with `<!--`

And end with a `-->`

### Challenge

Uncomment your `h1`, `h2` and `p` elements.

- [ ] Your `h1` element should be visible on the page by uncommenting it <!--has("h1")-->
- [ ] Your `h2` element should be visible on the page by uncommenting it <!--has("h2")-->
- [ ] Your `p` element should be visible on the page by uncommenting it <!--has("p")-->
- [ ] No trailing comment tags should be visible on the page (i.e. `-->`) <!--!hasText("--&gt;")-->
